Either party may terminate this Agreement for convenience upon ninety days’ prior written notice.

Termination for convenience shall not relieve the Client of payment obligations for services rendered prior to the effective termination date.

The affected party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of such event.

If a Force Majeure Event continues for more than sixty (60) consecutive days and materially prevents performance of essential obligations under this Agreement, the non-affected party may terminate the Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ written notice.

Termination pursuant to this Force Majeure clause shall not give rise to liability for damages arising from the termination itself.

However, any accrued payment obligations, confidentiality obligations, and indemnification obligations shall survive termination.

In lieu of termination, the non-affected party may elect to suspend services during a Force Majeure Event.
