Technical Documentation :
Technical Documentation Repository – Version 2.0

ABC Technologies Pvt. Ltd.
Last Updated: February 2026

This document serves as the centralized technical documentation repository for Version 2.0 of the ABC Technologies Developer Platform. It is intended for internal software developers, backend engineers, frontend developers, DevOps engineers, and integration partners who build and maintain applications using the company’s APIs and microservices architecture. The purpose of this repository is to provide detailed explanations of system architecture, authentication flows, API endpoints, request-response formats, security mechanisms, and deployment procedures.

Version 2.0 introduces a standardized authentication and authorization framework based on OAuth 2.0 with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). All client applications must authenticate using the secure token-based flow before accessing protected endpoints. The authentication server is responsible for issuing access tokens and refresh tokens after successful credential validation. The base URL for the authentication server in Version 2.0 is https://api.abctech.com/v2/auth
.

To implement the authentication flow in Version 2.0, developers must first register their application in the Developer Console. During registration, the system generates a unique client_id and client_secret. These credentials must be securely stored and never exposed in frontend source code. For server-side applications, credentials should be stored in environment variables or secure vault services.

The authentication flow begins with a POST request to the token endpoint located at /v2/auth/token. The request must include the client_id, client_secret, grant_type, and scope in the request body. The supported grant types in Version 2.0 are client_credentials and authorization_code. For machine-to-machine communication, the client_credentials grant type is recommended.

Below is a sample implementation of the authentication flow using Python:

import requests

url = "https://api.abctech.com/v2/auth/token"

payload = {
    "client_id": "your_client_id",
    "client_secret": "your_client_secret",
    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
    "scope": "read write"
}

response = requests.post(url, data=payload)
token_data = response.json()

access_token = token_data["access_token"]
print("Access Token:", access_token)

After receiving the access token, developers must include it in the Authorization header of all protected API requests using the Bearer schema. For example, when accessing the user profile endpoint at /v2/users/profile, the request header must include Authorization: Bearer <access_token>. Tokens issued in Version 2.0 are valid for 3600 seconds. Once expired, a new token must be generated using either the refresh token mechanism or by repeating the authentication request.

For frontend applications using JavaScript, the authentication flow can be implemented as follows:
fetch("https://api.abctech.com/v2/auth/token", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
  },
  body: new URLSearchParams({
    client_id: "your_client_id",
    client_secret: "your_client_secret",
    grant_type: "client_credentials",
    scope: "read write"
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log("Access Token:", data.access_token);
});

Version 2.0 also enforces enhanced security measures compared to Version 1.0. All requests must be made over HTTPS. TLS 1.2 or higher is mandatory. Requests made over HTTP will automatically be rejected. Additionally, rate limiting has been introduced to prevent abuse. Each client application is limited to 1000 requests per minute. Exceeding this threshold will result in a 429 Too Many Requests response.

Error handling in Version 2.0 follows standardized HTTP status codes. A 400 status code indicates a malformed request. A 401 status code indicates invalid credentials or expired tokens. A 403 status code indicates insufficient permissions for the requested resource. A 500 status code indicates an internal server error. Developers are encouraged to implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures.

The API response format in Version 2.0 follows a consistent JSON structure. Every successful response contains a status field, a data object, and a request_id for tracking. Error responses contain an error_code, message, and request_id. Logging the request_id is recommended when reporting issues to the support team.

For microservice integration, internal services communicate using service-to-service authentication with signed JWT tokens. These tokens are validated using the platform’s public key infrastructure. Developers must verify the token signature and expiration time before granting access to protected resources. Token validation libraries are available in Python, Node.js, and Java within the internal SDK repository.

Deployment guidelines for Version 2.0 require that all authentication-related environment variables be configured in the staging environment before production rollout. Configuration values must never be hardcoded in source files. Continuous Integration pipelines automatically scan repositories for exposed secrets and block deployment if vulnerabilities are detected.

This documentation repository is continuously updated to reflect architectural improvements, security patches, and API enhancements. Developers are advised to consult the latest documentation before implementing new features. For further clarification regarding authentication flows, API usage limits, or integration procedures, developers may contact the Platform Engineering Team via the internal support portal.

Security Best Practices

Developers must rotate client secrets at least once every ninety (90) days. Secrets compromised due to misconfiguration or exposure must be revoked immediately. Logging of authentication failures and suspicious access attempts is mandatory and integrated with the centralized security monitoring system.

Performance Optimization Guidelines

To ensure optimal API performance, clients should reuse access tokens until expiration and minimize unnecessary authentication requests. Caching responses where applicable and batching API calls are recommended for high-throughput applications.

Monitoring and Observability

All API requests are tagged with a unique request_id. Developers should log this identifier for debugging and incident investigation. Platform monitoring dashboards provide real-time visibility into latency, error rates, and throughput.

Versioning and Deprecation Policy

API versions follow a semantic versioning strategy. Deprecated endpoints remain supported for six months before permanent removal. Clients are notified in advance through official release notes.
