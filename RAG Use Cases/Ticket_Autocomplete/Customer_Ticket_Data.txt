Autocomplete System Behavior
When a new support ticket is received, the RAG system retrieves similar archived tickets.
The system generates a suggested response based on past resolutions.
Support agents must review and approve the drafted response before sending.

Expiration Handling Logic
Only non-expired tickets are indexed for retrieval.
Expired tickets are excluded from similarity search.
Newly resolved tickets are appended to the archive and indexed automatically.

Human-in-the-Loop Validation
